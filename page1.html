                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Erubiel and I am a first-generation student at The University of Colorado Boulder, home of the Prime. I grew up in the elevated mountains of the beautiful town of Glenwood Springs, Coloradoüèî</p>
    
                <p>Currently a LEEDS Business student, and well on my way to becoming a Computer Science üíª double major ü§ì</p>
                <p>I am very intrigued by the technology industry as I plan to hopefully begin my career in the areas of Cybersecurity or software programming. But I am also fascinated by handling big data and how to use predictive models to influence impactful company decisions.</p>
    
                <p>I have had multiple experiences and learned greatly in the work industry, starting out labor in constructionüë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, going to the restaurant industryüßëüèΩ‚Äçüç≥, a year in retailüè¨, and having my last job in plant health careüå≤. I am grateful for these experiences as I learned more about myself and capabilities.</p>

                <p>I enjoy learning a bit of everything!</p> 
                <p>Originally, I had a high interest in zoology & researching all the different organisms of the Animal Kingdom - emphasis on reptiles.</p>
                <p>Currently, I enjoy taking care of myself through the gym & taking all the nutrients I need. During school, I have the best time whenever I am challenged to type any code, in my first year I was able to code a functional space game with C++ and use keyboard digits as the visual base (unfortunately, I lost the code with my previous computer). </p>
                <p>Traveling the world is also a priority, being culturally ambiguous is a flex & the world has everything to show.</p>
                <p>For outdoor adventures I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, swimming & i'll be open to basically everything. I also enjoy gaming.<p>
